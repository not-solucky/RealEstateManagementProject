    L Checking whether the property document submitted by the user is the owner of the property --- to future me.

    L handleDashSubmitDocument might suffer from race condition where the condition check whether a document id exists for a particular property or not (very small case but dangerous.). solution: (using transaction or shift the whole checking thing to store function) --- to future me. must fix!!!

3. Pressing <Enter> key doesnt initiate login or signup process (optional)
